dotfiles
========

This repo is a dumping ground for config files and other useful scripts.

To use it, download the [dotg helper script](/bin/dotg) and run `./dotg clone-dotfiles <repo>`. The
repo will be cloned to the current user's home directory, putting all the files in the right places.

The [.dotfiles](/.dotfiles) directory can be used to store things that aren't directly usable as
configuration files. This includes setup scripts, instructions for manually setting up certain
applications, etc.
